- 👋 Hi, I’m @Emptyguru00
- 👀 I’m interested in sadhana, seva, and trying to help make this world a little bit better.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning well trying to learn about app publishing and coding and all that fun stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my app called Phenomenon, appy pie gave it to google without my knowledge or consent, then tried to erase the evidence completely, bu to i own the domain i attached it to, at least for alittle while longer. so im learning this on the fly.  im hoping that my app will make the need for 5 or 6 apps to make videos, even switching file type, editing, design, translation, captions obsolete. i want phenomenon to do all that work and have the file converter connected but not necessarily have to have to make a video to use it. im hoping to .ame it cheap enough for anyone at all to use, but id also need it to cover some costs, at minimum the domain and my websites im trying to get up. right now i cant even afford the price of using this copilot 
- 📫 How to reach me what's app 814 270 4440, or divineinstruments.us@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: seriously?
- ⚡ Fun fact: our government is systematically brainwashing and trying to enslave us.
